        <h1>More of me.</h1>
        <p>Besides what I wrote on the home page I could talk about the games I like to play and want to make. My favorite games are the ones that are based around a story. The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite and Life is Strange are some examples. I also love games that have interesting and fun gameplay like The Legend of Zelda and the Mario games. I'll play most games really, I just love the medium in general.
        </br></br>
        My career goal is to be the creative director for a high-budget story based game. Game design is my biggest passion within game development, iterating on the experience and developing concepts. I have several notebooks filled with ideas for games or mechanics, some of which you can see in my portfolio video.
        </br></br>
        Other than that I enjoy playing music, drawing, movies, books, comic-books, rock-climbing and spending time with friends and family. If there is anything else you'd like to know about me don't hesitate to send me an email!
